# Blast
Blast is my entree for The 2021 March 4th - March 12th Retro Game Jam.

Sorry about the poor quality of the code. 

We where supposted to limit ourselfs to a specific console. I didnt really do this because I couldnt find a 2D old console that supported 480p or the specific color pallet I wanted to use. So I Remade Atari Space Invaders. 

Compilation:

  This project Needs:
  
      Make >= 4
      GCC >= 7
      Raylib >= 3.5
