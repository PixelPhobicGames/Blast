# Blast
Blast is my entree for The 2021 March 4th - March 12th Retro Game Jam. This is also the first Game Jam Ive ever done 



Warning: Do not remove the Assets folder and Make sure You have some sort of audio device plugged in... The Game Won't turn on if not.


We where supposted to limit ourselfs to a specific console. I didnt really do this because I couldnt find a 2D old console that supported 480p or the specific color pallet I wanted to use. So I Remade Atari Space Invaders in the "Style" of A Snes / NES / Genesis Game. I did cheat a little by adding HD music instead of chiptune this is my bad. I didnt allocate time very properly so I just threw together some music in Garage Band and called it a day. I used Raylib 3.5 and C to make this game.

I hope you Enjoy The Game !  - Liquid
